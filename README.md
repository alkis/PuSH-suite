# PubSubHubbub 0.4 â€” Compliance test suite

Use this to test a server for compliance with the [PubSubHubbub spec](https://superfeedr-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html) at version 0.4.



## Example usage

    export HUB_URL=http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com; mocha test.js

This will run the test server. Note that this won't actually work unless the server behind HUB_URL can access this test server. In other words: do not run this on your local machine, unless it's visible from the web.

## Details

To use this test suite, you need to provide two URLS via the runtime environment:

- **HUB_URL**: this URL of the hub which will be tested for compliance with the PubSubHubbub spec

## An aside

To speed up development, I'm actually tunneling traffic from a public server of mine to my local machine.

1\. nginx config (on public server)

Assuming wildcard DNS is already set up for an existing subdomain, add this to an nginx sites-enabled configuration file:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name testsuite.example.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8455;
            proxy_redirect / /;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
    
Then `sudo service nginx reload`.

2\. ssh tunnelling (run from dev machine)

    ssh -R 8455:localhost:8000 user@testsuite.example.com -N        # blocks shell, add `-f` to run in background

3\. There is no step three! Actually there is: run the testsuite
